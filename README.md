# Categorical-Data-Analysis
The aim of this project is to build a customer churn model for a telecommunication company to predict the customers who are about to get churned so that they can implement different business strategies to retain those customers before they actually get churned. The tool that I am using for this analysis is R-studio. This project will be conducted in 2 different phase where I will be exploring different data analysis techniques to accurately predict the churned customers. Phase 1 of this project will include the detailed descriptive statistical analysis of the data by making use of various R packages to build relevant charts, graphs, and interactions etc. Data preprocessing will be done to clean and transform the data to suit the prediction model. This section will address the issues with the dataset like missing values, outliers etc. The second phase of this project is solely for the model building and includes the appropriate statistical procedures, the test of independence etc
